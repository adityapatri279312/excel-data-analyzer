4. **Course Design Review**: Analyze which course types have higher completion rates and apply those design principles

## Departmental Insights
- The data shows variation in completion rates across different departments, suggesting targeted interventions may be needed
- Assessment scores are generally good among those who complete courses

This analysis provides a foundation for deeper investigation into specific aspects of user engagement, course effectiveness, and completion patterns.
